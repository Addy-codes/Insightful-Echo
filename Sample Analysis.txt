The Homo sapiens commonly known as a human, clad in vibrant blue symbology possibly a form of tribal identification or just bad fashion, we can't be certain. Behold their habitat. A glorious mismatch of synthetic elements. And if one squints just right, a not entirely dead houseplant. Rather extravagantly. This creature sports a pair of hightech appendages around its ears. A musical indulgence, a possible mating call, or perchance simply their primitive tool for ignoring other specimens they cohabitate with. Life's Chaotic artifacts strewn casually, a loose testament to their hoarding tendencies. The single electrical outlet signifies their dependence on the electronic lifeblood pumped out from who knows where. Ah, humans. Always full of surprises and questionable decor choices. Marvelous, isn't it?
